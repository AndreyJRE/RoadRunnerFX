This game is my personal project, which I started doing while I was at university.

Basic Rules: 
If the main ball intersects the yellow ball, you get 10 points. Red ball takes away 20 points and the blue one is game over.
You can shoot only blue balls.

Game control:
  To turn left: A or left arrow.
  To turn right: D or right arrow.
  To jump: space or up arrow.
  To shoot: V
